## Background
We used pure vanilla javascript and object-oriented methodologies. There are two modes one is easy and the other is hard.
  - Easy: In this mode computer play through random input. User can easily defeat the computer.
  - Hard: In this mode computer use Minmax algorithm to make his turn in the board. So it's an unbeatable approach. User can draw but can't defeat the computer.
